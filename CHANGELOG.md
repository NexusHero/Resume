## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **KI-Qualität** — a **skill canonicalization taxonomy** (`domain/skill-taxonomy`) that
  unifies variants (React.js / ReactJS / react → React) before matching and display, and a
  **grounding self-check** (`domain/grounding`) that flags factual claims (numbers-with-unit,
  known skills) in AI-drafted pitch/outreach the CV + mandate don't support — surfaced in the
  Editor as a "nicht belegte Angaben" warning.
- **Documentation set** — a retroactive [requirements](docs/requirements.md) catalogue
  (FR/NFR), [use cases](docs/use-cases.md), and an [architecture decision log](docs/adr)
  (ADR-0001…0010); `docs/architecture.md` refreshed to the current recruiting/AI suite; the
  README's features + REST API surface brought current.

### Changed

- **SOLID cleanup (`core/`)** — split PDF merging out of `PdfRenderer` into its own `PdfMerger`
  port + `PdfLibMerger` adapter (ISP), and moved `slug()` into `domain/slug.ts` (SRP). Pure
  refactor, no behaviour change; branch coverage on the service rose to 100%.
- **English end-to-end** — the launcher and the **myJob** apps (recruiting workspace + applicant
  app) are now fully English (UI labels, sample data and copy). The CV / cover-letter pages keep
  their EN/DE toggle.

### Added

- **UI acceptance tests** with **Playwright** (`npm run test:e2e`) — boot the real server and
  drive the launcher and the recruiting workspace in a browser; wired into CI.
- Tag-triggered **release** builds a downloadable, runnable per-OS artifact (compiled
  `core/dist` + static app; `npm ci --omit=dev && npm start`).
- **TypeScript backend (`core/`)** — a layered, SOLID rewrite of the REST API: controller →
  service → repository, **Awilix** dependency injection (no decorators), **pino** structured
  logging, **zod** request validation, **RFC 9457 problem+json** errors, versioned routes under
  **`/api/v1`** (plus `/api/v1/health`), and an **OpenAPI 3** contract (`core/openapi.yaml`).
- Test suite: Jest unit + integration + **acceptance (supertest)** with **≥ 90 % coverage**
  (currently 100 % lines/functions, ~96 % branches) and **Stryker** mutation testing configured.
- arc42 building-block + runtime documentation and a building-block UML diagram.
- Project governance: GitHub Actions CI (format, lint, tests, conventional-commit check),
  CodeQL, security (npm audit + dependency review), docs (PlantUML render check) and a
  tag-triggered release pipeline that publishes a downloadable, runnable artifact.
- Community files: `CONTRIBUTING`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT`, `SECURITY`, issue forms and a PR template.
- Git hooks (`scripts/hooks/`): `pre-commit` runs format + lint + tests; `commit-msg` enforces
  Conventional Commits. Installable via `npm run hooks:install`.
- Tooling: Prettier, ESLint (flat config), EditorConfig, `.nvmrc`.
- [arc42](https://arc42.org) architecture documentation skeleton (`docs/architecture.md`) with
  the first PlantUML system-context diagram.
- **We now merge only via Pull Request — no direct pushes to `main`.**
