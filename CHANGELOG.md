## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Project governance: GitHub Actions CI (format, lint, tests, conventional-commit check),
  CodeQL, security (npm audit + dependency review), docs (PlantUML render check) and a
  tag-triggered release pipeline that publishes a downloadable, runnable artifact.
- Community files: `CONTRIBUTING`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT`, `SECURITY`, issue forms and a PR template.
- Git hooks (`scripts/hooks/`): `pre-commit` runs format + lint + tests; `commit-msg` enforces
  Conventional Commits. Installable via `npm run hooks:install`.
- Tooling: Prettier, ESLint (flat config), EditorConfig, `.nvmrc`.
- [arc42](https://arc42.org) architecture documentation skeleton (`docs/architecture.md`) with
  the first PlantUML system-context diagram.
- **We now merge only via Pull Request — no direct pushes to `main`.**
